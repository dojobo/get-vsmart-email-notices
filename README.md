This small project (my first github repo!) simply finds and gets the email notice text files generated by the Vsmart ILS for a given date, and reports how many notices were generated for each category (overdue notice, reservation pickup notice, invoice notice). This is very simple functionality, but a very important bit of automation if you need to confirm that notices were indeed generated as they were supposed to have been.

Initial commit does not do all these things yet. First steps are to create the proper file list using FTP.list and mtime. This will require some error handling. Once the list is created, a GET loop will download all of the files. Then I plan to use regex on the contents of the files to categorize and count them.
