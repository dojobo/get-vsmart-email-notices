This small project (my first github repo!) simply finds and gets the email notice text files generated by the Vsmart ILS for a given date, and reports how many notices were generated for each category (overdue notice, reservation pickup notice, invoice notice). 

The counting script (countnotices.py) is separate, and written in Python, because I found that Ruby had trouble with Windows file permissions.

The counting script also writes to a MS-SQL database. This provides a permanent record of the counts as well as email (using SQL Server's DB Mail) based on an INSERT trigger. TSQL scripts are in the /scripts/ folder for creating the table, triggers, stored procedures, and SQL Server Agent job. If you want the counts to simply print to the console, run countnotices-quiet.py instead.

USAGE: `getnotices.rb yyyy-mm-dd [yyyy-mm-dd]...` ; `countnotices.py yyyy-mm-dd [yyyy-mm-dd]...`
Just put in the date you want as a command-line argument. You can get multiple dates at once. Putting no date will default to today's.

Credentials are separated into credentials.yml. This should be in your .gitignore file. Use credentials-template.yml file and rename it as credentials.yml.
